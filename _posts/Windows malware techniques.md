Windows malware techniques to obfuscate the true intent of the software.

## Unpacking

Most malware comes packed one way or the other, where the true software get unpacked during runtime, making static analysis harder.

```text
VirtucalAlloc(Ex)
VirtualProtect(Ex)
WriteProcessMemory
CreateProcessInternalW
NtResumeThread
````

## Evasion techniques

### Dynamic loading API

Some malware author will load libraries dynamic in real time using the *LoadLibraryA* to find the nesscarry API needed for the software to run.  

### Process hollowing

Carves out the virtual memory of a process, which memory of the software then get written with the payload.

````text
List of running processes
    CreatToolhelp32Snapshot or EnumProcesses
Lunch process with suspended flag
    CreateProcesss 
Hollow out the virtual memory of a process
    NtUnmapViewOfSection or ZwUnmapViewOfSection
Allocates memory space in the child process for the injected coded
    VirtualAlloc(Ex)
Inject code into the newly allocated memory of the child process
    WriteProcessMemory
Resume the process to run the code. 
    ResumeThread
````

### Code injection

inject code into it own process or another process.

````text
List of running processes
    CreatToolhelp32Snapshot or EnumProcesses
Open handle to target processes
    OpenProcess
Allocates memory space in the child process for the injected coded
    VirtualAlloc(Ex)
Inject code into the newly allocated memory of the child process
    WriteProcessMemory
Resumes the process to run the code.
    CreateRemoteThread
````

### Processes iteration

Method within assembly to iterate over the current running processes.

````text
List of running processes
    CreatToolhelp32Snapshot or EnumProcesses
Get the first processes from the list returned by CreateToolhelp32Snapshot
    Process32FirstW
Get the next process in the list
    Process32NextW
````

### Virtualprotect manipulation

It is common to set the new memory to location protection to RWX[40],
Another way it first set the protection level to RW[04] and once the code have been written change the protection again to RX[20] to avoid AV detection

## Anti-debugging

### Getting Process Environment block (PEB)

fs: [30] = PEB <br>
Allows the program to get access to the PEB which can be used for multiple things e.g. checking if IsDebugging enabled

````text
mov eax, fs[30]
mov eax [eax+2]
test eax,eax
````

## Identifying interresting areas

Some techniques that have been developed as I reverse engineered software.

### Utility functions

If there isn't an test after an call it most likely not of interest as the function called not does have an return value and most likely an utility function.

### Decryption function

If the same function is called multiple times there high possibility it a decryption function

## Syscalls

Instead of using ntdll.dll to make syscalls, they are instead directly called by using the syscall ID of the call we want to execute.
