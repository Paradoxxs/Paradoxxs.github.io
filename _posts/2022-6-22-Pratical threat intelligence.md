Intelligence lifecycle, is an very high level process that can be mapped to multiple sources, SIGINT, HUMINT, etc. 

1. Direction
2. Collection
3. Processing
4. Analysis
5. Dissemination
6. Feedback

The question is how does this process map the cyber threat intelligence (CTI) 
and what action should be taken in the different stages.

Not all the stages are unqiue too cyber, specific direction, dissemination and feedback are very similar across all type of intelligence.
What all these stages have in common is they are all about the consumer.

Direction is all about the questions the consumer have for the intelligence team, so matter what source you are part of if the action is not based on the requirement, you are doing intelligence for intelligence sake. 

The other similar is Dissemination of the intelligence that have been generated. It key here that the intel get devlived in a form that they userstand and are able to take action, if that is not the case, then all the previous work will have been done for nothing. 



Cyber threat intelligence cycle:

1. Direction
    - Define the requirement for the intelligence team, what question should they answer.
2. Collection
    - Reading threat reports
    - Mitre attack techniques, and analysis what tactics are related to the threat actor within your requiement, and then how well you are protecting against these tatics. 
    - Threat hunting, take the tatics you discovered in your previous step and see if they are present within your organization, if they are found what are the context around them detection. 
    - IR, is a great place to intelligence as they are directly related to your organization. And you know the context of all the data.
3. Processing
    - Take the collected information, unify the data and stored it in an analysis bucket for analysis.
4. Analysis 
    - Payload analysis
    - Identity TTP
    - Previous activity seen from actor.
    - Pivot on the information discovered  
    - Identity overlapping infrastructure.
5. Dissemination
    - Create detection rules on the new tactics discovered
    - Share IOC
    - Report
6. Feedback
    - Iterate & improve the process

These are just some of the steps that are take during the Cyber threat intelligence, the goal of this article to take the intelligence cycle and map some of the action during the different stages.
